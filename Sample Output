Observation

You want a recipe for Beef Wellington.

Interpretation

You want a practical, cookable home version with correct wrapping, chilling, and temperature targets so the pastry stays crisp and the beef lands at your doneness.

Safety Triage

Green. Normal kitchen risks apply: hot oven, sharp knives, and food safety. Use a thermometer.

Actions

Beef Wellington (serves 4)

Ingredients

Beef
	•	1 center cut beef tenderloin, 2 to 2.5 lb, trimmed and tied
	•	Kosher salt, black pepper
	•	2 tbsp neutral oil
	•	2 tbsp Dijon mustard

Mushroom duxelles
	•	1.5 lb cremini mushrooms (or mixed mushrooms)
	•	2 shallots, minced
	•	2 garlic cloves, minced
	•	2 tbsp butter
	•	1 tbsp olive oil
	•	2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 2 tsp dried)
	•	Salt, pepper

Wrap and pastry
	•	8 to 12 slices prosciutto
	•	1 sheet puff pastry, thawed but kept cold (about 14 oz)
	•	1 egg + 1 tbsp water (egg wash)
	•	Optional: a little flour for dusting

Tools
	•	Skillet, baking sheet, parchment
	•	Plastic wrap
	•	Instant read thermometer

Step 1: Sear the beef
	1.	Pat beef dry. Season generously with salt and pepper.
	2.	Heat oil in a skillet on high. Sear all sides until deep brown, about 8 to 10 minutes total.
	3.	Remove to a plate and brush all over with Dijon while warm.
	4.	Chill 15 to 20 minutes to firm it up.

Step 2: Make the duxelles (dry mushroom paste)
	1.	Finely chop mushrooms.
	2.	Melt butter with olive oil over medium heat. Add shallots, cook 2 minutes.
	3.	Add mushrooms, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the mixture is very dry and paste like, 15 to 25 minutes.
	4.	Cool completely. Wet duxelles equals soggy pastry.

Step 3: Prosciutto wrap
	1.	Lay a big sheet of plastic wrap on the counter.
	2.	Overlap prosciutto into a rectangle large enough to wrap the beef.
	3.	Spread an even layer of cooled duxelles over the prosciutto.
	4.	Place beef in the center and roll tightly into a log using the plastic wrap to compress it.
	5.	Twist the ends tight and chill 30 minutes (or up to overnight).

Step 4: Puff pastry wrap
	1.	Heat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
	2.	Lightly dust the counter, roll pastry just enough to fit.
	3.	Unwrap the prosciutto log, place on pastry, and wrap snugly. Seal seams with egg wash. Trim excess.
	4.	Put seam side down. Brush all over with egg wash. Score light decorative lines on top without cutting through.
	5.	Chill 10 to 15 minutes for cleaner baking.

Step 5: Bake to temperature
	1.	Bake 15 minutes at 425°F to set the pastry.
	2.	Reduce oven to 400°F and continue until the center hits your pull temperature:
	•	Medium rare: pull at 120 to 125°F
	•	Medium: pull at 130 to 135°F
	3.	Total bake time is usually 25 to 40 minutes depending on thickness and how cold it started.

Step 6: Rest and slice

Rest 10 minutes before slicing. Use a sharp serrated knife for clean pastry cuts.

Quick success notes
	•	Duxelles must be very dry, and everything should be chilled before baking.
	•	Thermometer beats vibes. Wellington is a temperature project wearing a pastry costume.
